# Expo Go Setup for React Native Development

## Objective

Mobile development typically requires more computational resources than web development. To ensure a smooth and efficient development experience, this project uses the **Expo Framework for React Native**, which simplifies mobile app development and testing by allowing apps to run directly on physical devices.

This document records the setup process for **Expo Go** on a physical device and any challenges encountered.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Expo Go, ensure the following tools are installed and configured:

* **Node.js (LTS)**
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**
* **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows
* **Physical Mobile Device:** Android or iOS
* **Stable Internet Connection (Wi‑Fi recommended)**

All the above prerequisites were already installed prior to this task.

## Why Expo Go?

Using traditional emulators for mobile development can be resource‑intensive and difficult to maintain due to frequent device and OS updates.

**Expo Go** solves this by:

* Allowing real‑time testing on physical devices
* Supporting both Android and iOS
* Eliminating the need for heavy emulators
* Providing faster development feedback loops

## Expo Go Installation Steps

### 1. Visit Expo Go Website

Opened the official Expo Go page:

👉 [https://expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)

---

### 2. Select Latest SDK Version

Ensured the latest Expo SDK version was selected to maintain compatibility with current React Native features.

---

### 3. Install Expo Go on Physical Device

**Android:**

* Opened Google Play Store
* Searched for **Expo Go**
* Installed the application

**iOS:**

* Opened Apple App Store
* Searched for **Expo Go**
* Installed the application

---

### 4. Open Expo Go App

Launched the Expo Go app after installation.

---

### 5. Account Setup

* Logged in using an existing Expo account
* Alternatively, a new account can be created using email or GitHub

---

## Verification

* Expo Go opened successfully
* QR scanner was accessible
* App was ready to connect to local Expo development server

---


## Notes & Best Practices

* Ensure phone and development machine are on the same network
* Disable VPNs if Expo fails to connect
* Keep Expo Go updated from the app store
* Prefer Wi‑Fi over mobile data for stability

---

## Conclusion

Expo Go was successfully installed and configured on a physical device. This setup enables efficient React Native development without relying on resource‑heavy emulators, ensuring faster iteration and real‑device testing.

The environment is now ready for upcoming Expo and React Native projects.
